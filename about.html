  <h3 class="section-title section-title-exp">About Me</h3>
<p>I am an experienced graphic designer with over 8 years of experience working as both a freelance and in-house graphic designer. I have experience working directly with clients on original projects from concept to completion and working within brand guidelines. Iâ€™ve worked as a designer for large companies with established brands, such as Boeing, and Heinz, but I also love bringing an identity to life from scratch for startups and individuals.</p>

<p>I enjoy working with others and collaborating with talented photographers, web developers, copywriters, project managers, creative directors and others on assignments. I am an enthusiastic team player, but know how to work independently when needed. I am always very eager to learn from my peers, and seek out more educational opportunities that allow me to learn more about graphic design, and provide me with a deeper understanding of photography and interactive development.</p>
