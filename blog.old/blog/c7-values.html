<h1>Values</h1>

<h3>November 23, 2014</h3>

<p>When I have a good balance, between maintaining close relationships, meaningful work, and enough free time to explore my personal interests and take care of the many things in life that need attention, I am generally happiest. Maintaining integrity, and helping others are a part of that happiness as well. As far as dealing with stereotype threat, I think it's important to live by example, and to also take care of yourself, so that you are able to take a step back and process difficult situations. For me that means staying true to my values at all times. Life gets busy, but I like to have some time to collect myself each day. If possible, I like to get a workout in, because thats always helped me when I'm having a bad day or feeling down for some reason.</p>
