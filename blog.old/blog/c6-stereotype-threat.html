<h1>Thoughts on Stereotype Threat</h1>

<h3>November 16, 2014</h3>

<p>I have had negative stereotypes applied to me in the past, and felt that I was judged and treated in terms of those at times, which is incredibly uncomfortable, and distracting, especially in a work environment. Unfortunately, I think that many people have experienced this discomfort in their lifetimes, because of age, gender, race, sexual orientation, or religion, and can likely relate.</p>

<p>Stereotype threat can often be hard to handle, considering that the person stereotyping may not be able or willing to change, or acknowledge their behavior. At the same time there are people who just simply do not realize what they are doing. In this case I think a discussion can quickly deescalate a situation, and foster understating.</p>

<p>People are individuals shaped by their own experiences. I love to meet people and learn from them. Everyone is an individual to me, often carrying with them interesting stories that they have gathered over the years. I’d hate to miss out on really getting to know someone, because of silly stereotypes. In a work situation I believe that people should be judged on their work and how they work well with others.  I will always strive to make an environment more welcoming by example.</p>
