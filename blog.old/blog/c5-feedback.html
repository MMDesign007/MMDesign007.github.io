<h1>Feedback at DBC</h1>

<h3>November 9, 2014</h3>

<p>Despite reading over a challenge prior to the pairing sessions, it isn't something that you can really prepare for too much, since the intention is for you and your pair to solve the challenge together, so you are vulnerable to having someone see when you are confused or don't know something. Fortunately, I've always paired with someone that was willing to explain when I was stuck. I've realized it's important to ask for help too, when having difficulty with a concept.</p>

<p>Pairing with other students is great! It gives me the opportunity to work through problems with others who are going through the same learning process as I am. I like to talk through the challenges. Using two heads is better than one. I learn and grow working with the others at Dev Bootcamp.</p>

<p>I think feedback is a great way to know what your perceived strengths and weaknesses are. Reviewing my feedback helped me understand where I can improve, and where I have a strong understanding. Writing feedback is not necessarily difficult, but it does take some time to make sure that my feedback is actionable and specific, sometimes when I have a great pairing session, it's hard to write actionable feedback, because everything went so smoothly.</p>
