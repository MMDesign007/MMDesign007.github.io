<h1>Conflict</h1>

<h3>November 30, 2014</h3>

<p>I have in the past leaned more towards withdrawing, avoiding a situation, or being hard on myself in conflict.</p>

<p>I remember in one particular situation I was working on a blog for years with a friend. We both equally co-founded the blog, interviewed people for it, and I designed most of the graphics. At one point my friend began to take on more work for the blog, and feeling like it may takeoff she pushed me out of the project.</p>

<p>I was very busy with my day job at a certain point, so I didn’t have as much time to spend on it. Feeling hurt, I did withdraw, tried to avoid the situation, and I was hard on myself, even though I was overwhelmed with my day job, and difficult personal things going on at the time. I ultimately stepped away from the blog, but in hindsight, I feel like I sold myself short by handling it that way. I had worked on and co-founded the project for no pay for years, and didn’t deserve to be pushed out of it in the way that I was. What I learned is that, it is good to recognize how you deal with conflict for others and for yourself. If for example, you avoid certain conflicts, because you don’t want to rock the boat, I think in the end you are ultimately the one to suffer.</p>

<p>If I were to deal with a similar situation again, I would make sure we checked in regularly to set expectations for a specific time period, and talked about how we would handle the work load when one of us was busy with our day jobs or difficult personal matters. I also learned that it is really important to put things in writing. Anticipating potential conflicts is the best way to avoid them coming up at all. </p>
