      <h4>What Is Pair Programming?</h4>
      <p>Pair programming is when two programmers work together to build a project.
      Programmers can switch between driver and navigator roles.
      The benefits of peer programming benefits the project by minimizing mistakes,
      and allows for programmers to learn from eachother.</p>
      <h4>Why is pair programming important to DBC?</h4>
      <p>Pair programming mimics the experience in the workplace, and allows programmers to learn from eachother.</p>
      <h4>Compare Driver and Navigator</h4>
      <p>The navigator gives direction to the driver, and the driver executes the plan.</p>
      <h4>Reflections on First Pairing Session</4>
      <p>I felt that the first pairing session with DBC went well. I was able to look to my pair and guide when I got stuck.</p>
