<h1>How to ask a good question</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Be specific and concise</li>
  <li>Give examples</li>
  <li>Use resources to show people the problem. JSBin is a good resource for illuminating a coding  problem, and allowing others to copy and/or edit the code</li>
</ul>

<p>When you are asking a question in person I think it's helpful to break down the problem, step by step. When writing out a question, it's easier to break it down.</p>

<p>When asking a question in person I would give the audience the overall problem or project overview for context, and then break down the parts that I am having trouble with. In class, it may be helpful to relate the problem to lessons we learned there.</p>
