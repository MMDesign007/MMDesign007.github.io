<h1>Ruby Hashes vs. JavaScript Objects</h1>

<h3>November 23, 2014</h3>

<p>Objects can contain many values in JavaScript. For ex:<br>
var food = {appetizer:"salad", dinner:"steak", dessert:"pie"};<br>
The values are written in <b>name:value</b> pairs. The name and value is separated by a colon in Javascript. These pairs are called properties.</p>

<p>Ruby hashes can be constructed in a couple of different ways:</p><br>
food = { "appetizer" => "salad", "dinner" => "steak", "dessert" => "pie" }<br>
If the keys are always symbols, a hash can be written like this:<br>
food = { :appetizer => "salad", :dinner => "steak", :dessert => "pie" }<br>
You can also write hashes like this as well:<br>
food = { appetizer: "salad", dinner: "steak", dessert: "pie" }<br></p>

<p>The difference between the two is that hashes in ruby can be written in a couple of different ways, and keys can be symbols. In Ruby we call the pairing of a hash key / value pairs, and in JavaScript it's a name / value pair.</p>
