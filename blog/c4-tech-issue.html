<h1>Software Developer Shortage in the US</h1>

<h3>November 2, 2014</h3>

<p>The US Department of Commerce estimates that one million high tech jobs could go unfilled between now and 2020. The demand for software developers is accelerating faster than the supply in the United States. Technology is a fast moving industry, and with every passing year, we seem to rely on it more and more in our daily lives, so it is no surprise that this gap exists.</p>

<p>The good news is that there does seem to be a push to teach code in schools at younger ages, and programs like Dev Bootcamp are increasing in popularity, allowing for people to learn code in an accelerated program in a reasonable amount of time. Online tutorials are also a great resource, because they allow for self-motivated individuals to teach themselves.</p>

<p>Of course, with all of these resources available these interests are often fostered at younger ages. Only ten percent of US schools offer a computer science class, so many students are not aware of the field and the resources available to them. This oversight is certainly something that needs to be addressed to bring more people into the field.</p>

<p>Additionally, employers often look to hire people with four-year degrees from colleges and universities. To fill these roles with qualified people, employers may need to adjust this expectation. Many people who have not received four-year degrees are perfectly capable of filling these positions.</p>
