<h1>Inheritance & Composition</h1>

<h3>November 16, 2014</h3>

<p>Sometimes inheritance does not take into account changes that will be made on a project in the future. Future changes to a project may not require that one class shares all methods of another and it can be hard to test classes that re-use code from a superclass. If enough changes are made, the code may become hard to read and test. Also each time you create a subclass, you create more public methods, which may not be what a program needs in every case.
</p>

<p>Composition is an alternative to using inheritance. While with inheritance we view one class as a parent and another as the child, composition is viewed more like a relationship of parts making up an object, so it is easy to test individual components and add the logic you need, instead of inheriting all of the code from another class. </p>
