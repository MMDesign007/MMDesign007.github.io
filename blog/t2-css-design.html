<h1>Differences Between Margin, Border, and Padding</h1>

<h3>October 19, 2014</h3>

<p>I've decided to create a chart that shows the difference between margin, border, and padding, since I think it makes it more clear.</p>

<img src="chart.png">

<p>Margin: A margin is applied outside of your element and affects how far your element is away from other elements</p><br>

<p>Padding: This is applied to the inside of your element.</p><br>

<p>Border: A border shows the edge of an element.</p><br>
