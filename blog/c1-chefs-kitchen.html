<h1>Reflections on DBC Phase 0</h1>
<h2>Beginning a Learning Journey</h2>

<h3>October 11, 2014</h3>

<p>DBC is a collaborative environment that is successful in part, because of student's willingness to help, and support each other. This was touched upon in Shereef's Fireside Chat, and something that I have experienced in my first week of phase 0. Phase 0 is off-site, so I didn't know what to expect.  So far I've had a chance to video chat and message with others going through the program. Everyone has been wonderful, willing to share, helpful and encouraging. Even though phase 0 is off-site, I definitely don't feel alone in my learning journey.</p>

<p>My impression of DBC so far is a positive one, and I look forward to continuing it. I think a culture where people are genuinely kind, and eager to learn is a culture that I will thrive in. Going into DBC, I expected for the experience to be challenging, but enjoyable, and that is what I have found so far. I know there is still a lot to learn, but I am excited about taking this journey with my cohort, and meeting them in Chicago. Go Bison!!!</p>
