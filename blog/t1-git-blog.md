GitHub Version Control
A Helpful Tool For Developers
Oct 11, 2014


What are the benefits of version control?
Version control has many benefits. One of the main benefits is being able track changes as a project is being created. Developers will be able to re-vist older versions of a project if they need to, and their collaborators will be able to view that information as well. 

How does git help you keep track of changes?
Git allows you to mark changes and save them, so they can be viewed at anytime. When you record a commit using the command git commit, you can re-vist those commits later if you want to.

Why use GitHub to store your code?
GitHub is currently the largest code host on the planet, and boasts 16.2 million repositories. From my conversations with other developers and readings it is currently an industry standard. GitHub is a great place for developers to store their code and work with collaborators, and because it is an industry standard most developers are using it too.
