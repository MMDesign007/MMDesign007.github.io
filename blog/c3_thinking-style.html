<h1>Thinking Style and Learning</h1>

<h3>October 26, 2014</h3>

<p>According to the <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">Gregorc Thinking style</a> my approach to learning is Abstract Random. We were instructed to take the Gregorc Thinking Style assessment at the beginning of phase 0, and after 3 weeks at DBC I am realizing how accurate it really is for me. I do thrive in environments that are very people oriented, and I love working with others on projects, so the pair programming at DBC has definitely been good for me.</p>

<p>Another trait of abstract random thinkers is that they thrive in unstructured environments. I think that this is true for me, but I have also found that this part of Abstract Random thinking can be a bit distracting. I have had to re-wire a bit. Initially, I had issues with time management, but I found that I need structure to get through Dev Bootcamp phase 0. The Pomodoro technique, and time boxing, allows me to manage my time and stay on task.  Moving throughout the program, I will continue to stay on top of time management to make sure I complete and understand all of the required tasks.</p>
